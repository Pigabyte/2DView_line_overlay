# 2DView_line_overlay
This App is very simple and very hardcoded at this state, but its use case is very straight to the point so it never got to the point of making it more "user friendly".

Simple run, reads of picture with name provided in the Python File, capability of transparent background and "Always On Top" so you can work on the Editor.

Some example pictures of how lines were projected. In this case for Paths/Water margins.

Video below shows simple idea of use case.
